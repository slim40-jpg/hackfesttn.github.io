      <h2 class="mb-3">✍️ Word from the Founder</h2>
      <p>When I founded Hackfest in 2015, my vision was clear: to create a national platform where Tunisia’s cybersecurity talent could be discovered, challenged, and celebrated.</p>
      <p>At the time, aspiring ethical hackers had limited opportunities to apply their skills in real-world scenarios or connect with a broader community. Hackfest was created to bridge that gap — not just as a competition, but as a movement.</p>
      <p>Today, Hackfest is more than a Capture The Flag event. It’s a growing community — a place where students, professionals, and enthusiasts come together to learn, collaborate, and push the boundaries of ethical hacking. Each year, I’m inspired by the creativity, determination, and technical brilliance our participants bring to the table. That energy fuels our drive to keep evolving and raising the bar.</p>
      <p>As Founder and Chairman, I remain committed to keeping Hackfest open, inclusive, and high-impact — a true reflection of what Tunisian potential can achieve when given the space to shine. I also want to sincerely thank every organizer, sponsor, and participant who has contributed to Hackfest’s growth over the years — this journey wouldn’t be possible without you.</p>
